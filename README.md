Bitcoin Price Prediction


Project Findings
The project aims to predict Bitcoin prices using historical data and a Support Vector Regression (SVR) model. The dataset includes daily Bitcoin prices, and the model is trained to predict future prices based on this data.

Quantified Findings
Data Overview:

The dataset contains Bitcoin prices from August to September 2024.
Sample prices from the dataset:
2024-09-08: $54,476.60
2024-09-07: $54,156.50
2024-09-06: $53,966.80
Model Used:

Support Vector Regression (SVR) Model: Implemented using a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel with parameters 
- ùê∂ = 1000.0 C=1000.0 and 
- ùõæ = 0.00001 Œ≥=0.00001.

Data Processing:

The dataset was split into training and testing sets with an 80-20 split.

A 30-day prediction window was set to predict future prices.

Prediction Results:

- SVR Model Accuracy: The model achieved an accuracy of 11.88%.
- Predicted Prices vs. Actual Prices for the test set:
- Predicted: $64,290.40, Actual: $66,773.10
- Predicted: $62,069.03, Actual: $56,057.80
- Predicted: $61,813.46, Actual: $61,699.70

Predicted Prices for Next 30 Days:

- Day 1 Prediction: $62,187.50
- Day 15 Prediction: $63,870.71
- Day 30 Prediction: $62,870.24

Price Range for Predictions:
- Predicted prices for the next 30 days range from $61,277.77 to $65,638.90.

Summary Insights
- The model's prediction accuracy is relatively low (11.88%), suggesting the need for further optimization, possibly by adjusting model parameters or incorporating additional features.
Predicted prices show a trend of slight fluctuation within a range of $4,361.13 over the next 30 days.
The SVR model's predictions are somewhat consistent but require improvements for more reliable forecasting of Bitcoin prices.
